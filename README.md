# Utility meter

# About
Plan:
1. Get low power sampling with SAADC working (/)
2. Add light sensor, and see if I can detect the blinking from the
   utility meter (/)
3. Try it on a Raspberry Pi to use as a gateway (x)
4. Add nRFCloud functionallity (x)


# To run
Ideally it should be

    make
    make flash
  
But rarely that will suffice, you probably have to at least change 
SDKPATH in the Makefile


# Excuses
I'm not a professional embedded programmer (i.e I don't get paid to 
program embedded code), so I'm sorry if you find these examples a bit
messy.

Any concrete criticism/improvment requests are welcome. Send me a
private message on devzone.nordicsemi.com

# Disclamer
This is not an official Nordic Semiconductor release, it's examples
I've compiled in my "offline" time.
