=== Barebone examples

== About
I'm Carsten Wulff, and I'm one of the engineers that worked on the
SAADC on nRF52. These examples are some of my barebone tricks and tips
on how SAADC can be used.

== To run
Ideally it should be

  make
  make flash
  
But rarely that will suffice, you probably have to at least change 
SDKPATH in the Makefile

== Origin
I've based this example on the uart ble example in nRF5_SDK_11, so you
need to download that.

== Excuses
I'm not a professional embedded programmer (i.e I don't get paid to 
program embedded code), so I'm sorry if you find these examples a bit
messy.

Any concrete criticism/improvment requests are welcome. Send me a
private message on devzone.nordicsemi.com

== Disclamer
This is not an official Nordic Semiconductor release, it's examples
I've compiled in my "offline" time.
